            <p>
              Having a world that floats
              amongst the clouds allows for its
              own unique challenges but allows
              for the imagination to run wild
              of the wildlife that would
              inhabit such a planet.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Movies such as Treasure Planet
              and avatar where a huge inspiration
              to the forms of transport and wildlife
              that the world would have
              and Avatar is the inspiration for
              the islands themselves.</p>
