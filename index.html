            <p>
              Having a world that floats amongst the clouds allows for its own
              unique challenges but allows for the imagination to run wild of
              the wildlife that would inhabit such a planet.

            <br />
            <p>
              Movies such as Treasure Planet and avatar where a huge inspiration
              to the forms of transport and wildlife that the world would have
              and Avatar is the inspiration for the islands themselves.
